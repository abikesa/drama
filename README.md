You are my Father, for me thinkes in you      
I see old Gaunt aliue. Oh then my Father,    
Will you permit, that I shall stand condemn'd    
A wandring Vagabond; my Rights and Royalties    
Pluckt from my armes perforce, and giuen away    
To [vpstart Vnthrifts?](https://abikesa.github.io/henryv/) Wherefore was I borne?    
If that my Cousin King, be King of England,    
It must be graunted, I am Duke of Lancaster.
